# Project-Tic-Tac-Toe

In this project I will be creating a game of tic-tac-toe where two users can play against each other until a winner is determined.

<h1>What I learned:</h1>

<ul>
    <li>How to use modules and function factories to store information</li>

    <li>When to use objects, function factories, or modules depending on the purpose of code</li>

    <li>When to use global or local variables depending on how accessible certain code should be</li>
</ul>
